When the config option "ancestor-masks-included" is unset, which is it
by default, the image asset of this PSD should be
ancestor-masks-not-included.png. When the the config option
"ancestor-masks-included" is explicitly set the image asset of this
PSD should instead be ancestor-masks-included.png. 

The test framework is not currently flexibile enough handle both of
these cases automatically, but both results are included here for
manual verification.
